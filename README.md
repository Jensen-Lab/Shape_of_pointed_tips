## Abstract
Despite their ubiquity in nature, spikes or stingers rarely exhibit sharp tips. Instead, a closer
look at their roughly conical tips reveals a striking similarity in shape: they follow a power-law
profile, z~radius^n, where n ≈ 2. This conformity appears across a wide range of spatial
scales and materials. In this work, we use model experiments and continuum theory to
demonstrate that this universal tip morphology results from stochastic weathering
processes. Specifically, we examine the evolution of the geometry of pencil tips, tracking
the transformation of their initial, sharp, linear profile to the convergent universal contour,
when subjected to random wear. This finding is particularly significant in light of recent
observations of consistent tip profiles of biological stingers (Quan et al., 2024; Evans et al.,
2021), the generality of tip contours of spindles formed by dissolution (Nakouzi et al., 2014),
and the geomorphic evolution of natural pinnacles due to wet erosion (Huang et al., 2020)
– all of which exhibit this universal profile.

## Popular Summary
Sharp, spine-like structures, or stingers, are everywhere in nature,
appearing in creatures as diverse as tiny zooplankton, elephants,
honeybees, and narwhals. These pointed shapes are a prime example
of convergent evolution, where different species independently
develop similar solutions—in this case, a simple yet effective defence
mechanism. Remarkably, a closer look at the tips of these structures
reveals a consistent shape: rather than ending in a sharp point, they
taper to a rounded cone with a specific geometry. Interestingly,
although stingers vary in size, if we rescaled them, they would show
the same profile. It has been suggested that similarity across species
results from evolutionary selection pressures that favour efficient
penetration into soft surfaces.

However, our research shows that these characteristic tip shapes arise
from a simpler, underlying physical process – random wear. Using
model experiments and continuum theory, we demonstrate that
random weathering alone can produce this universal shape, regardless
of material or structure. This convergent form isn’t unique to stingers;
the same shape appears in natural structures like icicles and stone
pinnacles formed by erosion. To recreate this in the lab, we exposed
sharpened pencil tips – a model stinger – to random collisions and
vibrations for hours, observing as they transformed over time into the
same universal profile.

Our findings suggest that the consistent shape of these pointed tips
across diverse forms is not the result of evolutionary selection but
rather an inevitable consequence of random wear—a compelling
example of how stochastic processes can sculpt the natural world into
strikingly similar forms, reminding us that some coincidences are
simply random.
